# Neural Style Transfer using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub

This repository contains a Python script for performing Neural Style Transfer using a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub. The script loads content and style images from specified directories, applies style transfer, and evaluates the quality of stylized images based on various metrics.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Hub
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- PIL (Pillow)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
2. **Install Dependencies:**

3. **Mount Google Drive:**
If you're running this code on Google Colab, make sure to mount your Google Drive.

4. **Organize Images:**
Place your content images in the `content` directory and style images in the `styled` directory within your Google Drive.

## Usage

Run the `DashToon(Generative_AI).ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment or Google Colab. Follow the instructions and modify parameters as needed.

## Output

The script will display and save stylized images along with evaluation metrics such as stylistic accuracy, content preservation, and visual appeal.
